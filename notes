DJKD-JKDJ-KDJK-DJKD

We have three placements of data

One we want to repeat our callsigns as often as we can.

DJKD repeated with a value to other nodes with the value set to a private key value stored on mine related to their repeater callsign

This means I own that block of sequence in that region at each depth of a sequence of 4 chars.

My system is encouraged to replace this data with either profitable hosting of data in exchange for codespace to store our repeater callsign
