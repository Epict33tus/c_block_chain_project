Each buffer (TODO - RENAME) acts as a register in local barriered VM. 

e.i. GGGG might store a full image over time in addition to other data and part of an image in the main register

i.e. GGGG-CCCC might contain the coordinates to the next part of the image in integer data or private keys in its history

The job of GGGG as a node in the network org is to repeat it's sequence in a unique way that only a mitm can organize on the public network,
and on the private network to store data or private keys to reference trust for other nodes to camp the namespace.
