## Usage:

    ./arg.sh

runs the core program counter interface for the default envs (can be set to your combination)

    RIGS=3 ./rigs.sh

set rigs to the number of repeaters that you want to "simulate" on the network.

TODO - `rigs.sh` only works on Darwin. I'll add support for backgroud processes for other systems...
