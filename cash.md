We have a limit on our network to communicate char values that can become integers. This is not an artificial limiter in a system where the character value is encoded in a human readable format at any size.

The character and integer size might be the same in some instances.

We make it difficult to set the value higher than the character value or restrict the character size but can on our own system set a higher integer.

The other nodes with seperate integer setters will eventually agree with our numbers or we adjust our numbers towards their limit.

They are encouraged to set the higher number on their systems if we occupy our owned namespace at consistent integers on their system to reduce our attempt to store data and control their computation.
